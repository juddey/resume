# Justin Lane

My Resume, built in React.

## Why?
Well, to prove that @juddey can code, and also to test [kryptonite](https://github.com/juddey/ignite-kryptonite) on a real example. Software is never software until its in the wild.

## Install
Because we're `create-react-app` based, you can just:
1. `git clone`
2. `yarn install`
3. `yarn start`, and
4. point your browser at `localhost:3000`.
