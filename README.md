# Justin Lane

My Resume, built in React, to prove that @juddey can code. Also a good test for my generator template called [kryptonite](https://github.com/juddey/ignite-kryptonite) which I wrote for [ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite). (see what I did there) 

Software is never software until its in the wild.

## Install
Because we're `create-react-app` based, you can just:
1. `git clone`
2. `yarn install`
3. `yarn start`, and
4. point your browser at `localhost:3000`.


This way to the [FAQ](./FAQ.md). :point_right:
