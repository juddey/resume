# FAQ
(in no particular order)

#### Why are there so many libraries in your package.json?

Well, because I was testing a [generator](https://github.com/juddey/ignite-kryptonite) I made for web projects, and I wanted to try it out.

I'm also going to wire in some live updating Github stuff too. One day.

#### Why is there a setup for redux and friends when you haven't actually done anything with it? 
See above. :point_up:

#### You've got react-native on your skill set, but I wanna see some code!
You might have to [ask me](https://twitter.com/juddeylane).

#### My screen goes white! Does this mean you have no skills?
No, that's becuase I haven't polyfilled yet. I might not even, but you could always try upgrading your browser to see whats going on.

#### Please, take me back to the front page. [OK.](https://github.com/juddey/resume)
